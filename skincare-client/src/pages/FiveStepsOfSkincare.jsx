        <h2>There are 5 primary steps to skincare. In the order these would normally be done, these steps are :  </h2>
        <h2> 1. Cleansing : Imagine your skin as a fortress with towering walls (the stratum corneum). Cleansing is like maintaining those walls it removes dirt, oil, and impurities, keeping your skin's security system intact</h2>
        <h2> 2. Exfoliating : Think of this as spring cleaning for your skin. Exfoliants are like brooms and dusters, sweeping away dead skin cells to reveal fresh, radiant skin underneath</h2>
        <h2> 3. Treatment : Products with targeted ingredients for treating specific skin concerns.</h2>
        <h2> 4. Moisturizing : Picture moisturizers as your skin's trusty canteens. They provide much-needed hydration, like a weary traveler needing a sip to keep going. Hydrated skin stays fresh and plump</h2>
        <h2> 5. Protection : Sun damage accounts for a very large portion of skin aging, and sun screen will protect against it.</h2>
