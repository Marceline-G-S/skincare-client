            <h2> Once enough time has passed that you are satisfied you know the results of the product, you can either stop use, consider it a part of your regular routine, or make note of the occasions you -would- like to use it.</h2>
            <h2> From there, you repeat the process with however many products you feel necessary. </h2>


            <h2> That's it! Your done! You know the basics and how to start and build a skincare routine. </h2>
