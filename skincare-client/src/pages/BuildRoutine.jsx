        <h2> The process to build a skincare routine is relatively simple.</h2>
        <h2> With each product you add, remember to do a skin patch test. This is done by putting a small amount of the product on a safe bit of skin and waiting to ensure your skin has no allergic or negative reactions. If your skin has an immediate negative reaction, discontinue use immediately and wash off the skin.</h2>
        <h2> With each product you add, allow about a week of use before adding a new product. This will ensure you have a good grasp on how the product affects your skin. </h2>
        <h2> Keeping a record of how your skin looks and feels before and after each product will allow you to track progress more accurately. Most improvements are gradual, so you're unlikely to notice the difference without a side by side record.</h2>

        <h2> 1. Determine your skin type. Many products work best for specific skin types, and say as such. This knowledge will get you a good starting point.</h2>
        <h2> 2. Most soaps are harsh on the skin, and will damage the skin barrier. Start with a good cleanser appropriate for your skin type.</h2>
        <h2> 3. Once the cleanser is done, you can begin adding more products. Each product you add should address at least one concern, but preferably multiple.</h2>
        <h2> 4. Once you're satisfied with how your skin feels, you're done. </h2>

        <h2> As long as your skin doesn't have a negative or allergic reaction, there's no meaningful limit to how much skincare you can use, but there's no need to overdo it.</h2>
